React is all the rage right now and there has never been a better time to start learning it. Although React has a realtively easy learning curve compared to other front-end frameworks (React is not exactly a framework), it can be very dauting for a beginner to compile React apps.

React by itself isn't that difficult, but the introduction of JSX in React and the bundling of these files using Webpack and loaders like Babel and the lack of good documentation can be very off-putting for even the most dedicated learners.

It is definitely very important to learn how all the pieces of the puzzle fit together and to know how to to configure a React app from scratch. But, many would like to simply bypass all these configurations and setups and move right to all the good stuff that React has to offer.

To get you started with React immediately, this simple ReactJS boilerplate application will let you do just that.

Using this repository, you can get started creating awesome ReactJS apps in just one command!

This boilerplate comes with ReactJS (duh) and other modules like:
1) SCSS loaders
2) Babel loaders
3) Plug-ins for jQuery
4) The Mocha testing framework and reporters
5) Foundation styles and the ability to override the global Foundation SCSS variables (Many prefer Foundation over Bootstrap for SCSS development with React)
6) Testing pre-processors
7) Soure map for debugging
8) Many more Webpack and Karma configurations
9) Finally, a robust folder structure

Usage:
Just fork the repository, clone it, and run the command "npm i" to get all the node modules necessary, and you are good to start creating awesome ReactJS applications!

For reference, a simple React app created with this boilerplate (along with an entire test suite):

ReactJS Timer App.
